      The purpose of this web page is to act as a place that those who are interested in environmental issues can go to Learn

        Starting with the basics:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes people try changing to much too quickly, it’s my opinion that often the best way to produce a large change is by starting small.
      Some ideas for some small things that you can try doing today are:

        <br><br>
        - Swapping some of the normal items that you have in your weekly shop for some vegan alternatives such as Tofu instead of chicken or veggie patties instead of beef patties.
        <br><br>
        - When you go shopping bring your own bag instead of paying for one at the shops.
        <br><br>
        - Before putting on the heating, put some more layers on first.
        <br><br>
        - Use a metal water bottle instead of a plastic one.
        <br><br>
        - As you walk home, if you see a small piece of litter, pick it up and put it in the bin
        <br><br>
        - If something is old, instead of throwing it out, try finding an alternate use for it. Such as using old cloths as Pyjamas
        <br><br>
        These are just some of the many examples of small things you can do. 
        The key thing is to try and see what works for you, finding what way to help lower your environmental impact is the main goal
        and as long as you try even if you find one way doesn't work, that’s ok you can just try a different way.

    <h2>
      Common Environmental Questions?
    </h2>
  </div>
    <button class="collapsible">How can I reduce the amount of plastic i use?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <br>
      <P>
      Plastic has become a very common thing that we all use, It does have its uses, for example in food preservation. However, in the past few decades
      plastic has started to become part of people’s lives more and more as they look for plastic solutions to problems that already have more sustainable
      options available. One of the largest contributing factors is large oil companies putting approximately £180bn into plastic products. With such a large
      amount of money being put into creating and marketing plastic items its no wonder there has been an increase in plastic products.
      <br><br>
       What the increase in plastic use has caused is lots of plastic waste to builds up and causes large amounts of damage to local wildlife. Wild animals will often accidently
        consume the plastic or even get their heads stuck in open plastic bottles which unfortunately often leads to there early deaths. It’s not just animals
        that get effected, recently it has been discovered that due to the animals we eat consuming plastic it means that we are also consuming an alarming
        number of micro plastics. These micro plastics cause harm to our bodies and can increase our risk of various cancers.
      </P>
      <h3>
        Examples of uses of plastic and some more sustainable options to use instead:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Plastic Water Bottles :</b> are probably one of the most common ones. They are available in every shop and are typically used once then thrown away.
        A simple alternative is to use a metal water bottle instead, They are more expensive but if you use it over a long time it will become cheaper than
        had you used an equivalent amount of plastic bottles.

<button class="collapsible">Is honey vegan?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  We often hear talk about signing petitions to "save the bees" but what are people talking about, Honeybee populations have only grown?
  Thats the problem, <b>HONEY</b> Bee populations have grown but other species of bee have either had the populations severely reduced or have even 
  gone extinct due to the increase in Honeybee populations. Because of the common confusion that all bees are the same it leads to people miss understanding
  the problem that we currently have. When they see headlines about all-time highs for honeybee population, they think it is a good thing, to an extent
  it is good that there is an insect population that is doing well. However, problems arise when Honeybees are the only species of bee doing well. With
  the most obvious being the lowering of biodiversity in areas that Honeybees are farmed.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What’s the difference between a Honeybee and any other kind of Bee?
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are roughly 274 species of wild bee, with 24 of them being extant bumble bees and 250
    of them being solidary bees. Solidary bees are bees that live on their own, they do not form 
    groups/hives. extant bumble bees are of the genius Bombus and they do live form hives.
    <br><br>
    Compared to the large variety of bumble bee species there is only one species of honeybee, <b>Apis Mellifera</b>,
    There are different sub species and some colour variation which will often have different common names.
    Although while they may have a different common name, they are all still the same species.
    Despite being only one species, the honeybee is not endangered and its population has only grown in recent years.
    <br><br>
    The key difference between bumble bees and honeybees is that bumble bees do not produce honey.
    The reason that they do not is because during the summer their queens will mate and then during
    the winter the queen hibernates while the rest of the hive dies, she will then wake up in the spring
    for this reason, there is no point for them to make honey. Honeybees on the other hand do not do this and
    need to create enough food to survive over the winter and they do this by producing honey.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is so bad about honeybees?
  </h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned before, Honeybees reduce the biodiversity of wherever they are farmed. There are many reasons for this, here are just a few of the
    main reasons:
    <br><br>
    <b>Plant Optimisation: </b> What this means is that farmers have found out that certain flowers will produce more pollen that the bees
    can use to produce more honey. Because of this it is common for farmers to only grow one species of flower that is most optimised for their bees
    this leads to a drop in the plant diversity around where bees are commonly farmed.
    <br><br>
    <b>Competition: </b> Honey bee colonies have been found to collect between 10.5 and 46.75 kg of
    pollen annually, this means that any area with a honey bee colony will see a dramatic decrease in 
    the amount of pollen that is available to other species of bee and insect that use the pollen as a food source. 
    Many bumble bee species have even been shown to change their behaviour and go for lower pollen count 
    plants to avoid direct competition with honeybees. It has been shown that in areas where honeybee
    populations are controlled or lowered, wild bee populations are higher and more diverse.
    <br><br>
    <b>Disease Transmission: </b>Several diseases affecting honeybees can be found in bumblebees. 
    The seriousness to bumblebees of most of these diseases is not yet precisely known, but 
    bumblebees infected with Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) are known to develop deformed wings and
     suffer higher mortality. Bumblebees have also been found carrying the fungal pathogen 
     Nosema ceranae, a new disease of honeybees, and infectious diseases have been implicated 
     in bumblebee declines.
     <br> Disease transfer takes place mostly through the shedding of disease particles 
     onto shared flowers. DWV is the best-studied of these diseases, and the human-caused 
     movement of managed honeybees has been found to be the source of DWV outbreaks in 
     bumblebees. As many other diseases are likely to be spread in a similar fashion, it
      is reasonable to assume that having managed bees in close proximity to vulnerable 
      populations of wild bees will present a high risk of infecting these wild bees with 
      new diseases.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What can be done to reduce the negative impacts of honey bees?
  </h3>
  <p>
    <b>Plant Diversity: </b> One way to reduce the impact of honey bees on bio diversity is to
    insure that even in areas where honeybees are farmed, farmers should plant a wide variety of Plant
    species. This will help ensure a more diverse eco system which encourages the growth of
    various pollinator species.
    <br><br>
    <b>Hive Positioning: </b>It is vital that bee keepers avoid putting hives in environments where endangered
    species of wild bee live as the competition between the honey and wild bees will likely cause the 
    endangered species to either go extinct or severely reduce there numbers. As such it is important
    to serve the area and be aware of what pollinators exist in an area before placing a beehive and insure
    that they are spaced in a way that it still allows room for wild bee populations.
    <br><br>
    <b>Buy Less or no honey: </b> The reason farmers are able to have more honey bees is because there is growing
    demand for more honey, if consumers ate less honey, then it would mean farmers have less incentive to build more
    hives as profit margines would be lower.
    <br><br>
    <b>Look out for petitions to sign: </b>There are various organisations that will often put out petitions
    for people to sign for things such as reducing the number of harmful pesticides used to protecting an area with
    endangered bee species within them. Showing that you have an interest in the wellbeing of bees will help
    push more people and organisations in the direction of better bee preservation.
  </p>
  <h3>How is honey harvested? </h3>
  <p>
    There are many ways to harvest the honey from the hives, some more ethical than others. I will detail 
    one of the ethical ways that honey can be harvested, this method is usually used by small scale
    bee keepers and hobbyists.
    <br><br>
    During what most would consider a more ethical way of farming in order To harvest
     honey, beekeepers pull a frame from the hive and use a hot knife to cut away the wax. 
     Many keep the wax to make candles.
     <br><br>
     The next step in the process involves a honey extractor. 
     This is a device that takes the liquid honey out of a honeycomb 
     without destroying the frame. That way, the frame can be put back into 
     the hive and used again. Once the honey sits for a few days, it’s ready to
      bottle and eat.
    <br><br>
    When harvesting honey, it’s important to only take the 
    extra honeycombs the bees don’t need. That’s especially true when 
    beekeepers harvest during fall. Bees need honey to survive over the 
    winter. If you take too much, the hive may not make it.
    <br><br>
    However, responsible harvesting doesn’t harm bees. 
    Beekeepers work hard to protect their hives and do their best not to 
    remove too much honey. If you’re thinking of keeping bees, spend plenty of 
    time learning about how to care for a hive. It’s best to get advice from an 
    expert before you start. 
    <br><br>
    After all, bees play an important part in our ecosystem.
     It’s important for people to do what they can to help them. 
     That’s especially true for beekeepers who take responsibility for 
     their care. Do you dream of harvesting fresh honey from your own backyard 
     one day? Many think it’s a fun and very rewarding hobby!
    <br><br>
    The above was taken from <b>Wonderopolis Wonder of the day#2610 How do you harvest honey?</b>

    <br><br>
    In the case where honeybees are ethically farmed, very little harm is done to the bees during the collection process. However, it is important
    to make people aware that there are still aspects of the practice of keeping bees that do cause harm to the bees. However, this does fall a little
    bit out of the scope of if honey is vegan or not so i will link to a webpage that talks about the ethics of bees. depending on your moral values 
    you may or may not agree with the website but i still believe it is good to be aware of other people’s perspectives so you can better grow your own morals.

  </p>
  <h3>
    What is honey?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Nectar is the main ingredient for honey and also the main source of energy for bees. Using a 
    long straw-like tongue called a proboscis, honeybees suck up nectar droplets from the flower’s special 
    nectar-making organ, called the nectary.
    <br><br>
    When the nectar reaches the bee’s honey stomach, the stomach 
    begins to break down the complex sugars of the nectar into more simple 
    sugars that are less prone to crystallization or becoming solid. This process 
    is called “inversion”.
    <br><br>
    Once a worker honeybee returns to the colony, it passes the nectar
     onto another younger bee called a house bee (between 12-17 days old).
     <br><br>
     House bees take the nectar inside the colony and pack it away in hexagon-shaped
      beeswax honey cells. They then turn the 
     nectar into honey by drying it out using a warm breeze made with their wings.
     <br><br>
     Once the honey has dried out, they put a lid over the honey cell using 
     fresh beeswax – kind of like a little honey jar. In the winter, when the flowers 
     have finished blooming and there’s not as much nectar available, the bees can open 
     this lid and share the honey they saved.
  </p>
  <h3>
    So is honey vegan or not?
  </h3>
  <p>
    That will depend on why, you, the individual decided to be vegan. In my opinion if you are vegan
    for environmental reasons i feel as though it is your best interest to avoid consuming honey. However, if your 
    a vegan for the reasons related to reducing animal suffering then it can be justified that so long 
    as you get your honey from a responsible beekeeper then there is no issue with consuming honey. Like i said
    before it all comes down to your own choices and moral opinions. Just do whatever feels right to you.

<button class="collapsible">Should i stop eating products with palm oil in them?</button>
<div class="content">
  <h3>
    The short answer is no... Let me explain:
  </h3>
  <p>
    The problem is that palm oils produce a large yeild for a relativly low cost and the yeild is of a very high quality. The reason that this is an
    issue is because in trying to reduce enviromental impact by using alternatives to palm oils, unfortunately, you are actually likely doing
    more harm to the enviroment.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is palm oil?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It’s an edible vegetable oil that comes from the fruit of oil palm trees, the scientific name is Elaeis guineensis. 
    Two types of oil can be produced; crude palm oil comes from squeezing the fleshy fruit, and palm kernel oil which comes from
     crushing the kernel, or the stone in the middle of the fruit. Oil palm trees are native to Africa but were brought to South-East 
     Asia just over 100 years ago as an ornamental tree crop. Now, Indonesia and Malaysia make up over 85% of global supply but there are
      42 other countries that also produce palm oil.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What products is palm oil used in?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Palm oil is in nearly everything – it’s in close to 50% of 
    the packaged products we find in supermarkets, everything from pizza, 
    doughnuts and chocolate, to deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste and lipstick. 
    It’s also used in animal feed and as a biofuel in many parts of the world (
      not in the UK though!). 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Why is palm oil everwhere?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Palm oil is an extremely versatile oil that has many different properties 
    and functions that makes it so useful and so widely used. It is semi-solid at room 
    temperature so can keep spreads spreadable; it is resistant to oxidation so can give 
    products a longer shelf-life; it’s stable at high temperatures so helps to give fried 
    products a crispy and crunchy texture; and it’s also odourless and colourless so doesn’t
     alter the look or smell of food products. In Asian and African countries, palm oil is used 
     widely as a cooking oil, just like we might use sunflower or olive oil here in the UK.
     <br><br>
As well as being versatile, compared to other vegetable oils the oil palm is a very 
efficient crop, able to produce high quantities of oil over small areas of land, almost 
all year round. This makes it an attractive crop for growers and smallholders, who can rely
 on the steady income that palm oil provides
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is the problem with palm oil?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Palm oil has been and continues to be a major driver
     of deforestation of some of the world’s most biodiverse forests,
      destroying the habitat of already endangered species like the Orangutan,
       pygmy elephant and Sumatran rhino. This forest loss coupled with conversion 
       of carbon rich peat soils are throwing out millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases 
       into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. There also remains some exploitation of 
       workers and child labour. These are serious issues that the whole palm oil sector needs to step up to 
       address because it doesn’t have to be this way.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What are some of the solutions?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Palm oil can be produced more sustainably and there is a
     role for companies, governments, and consumers to play. 
     The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil  or RSPO was formed
      in 2004 in response to increasing concerns about the impacts 
      palm oil was having on the environment and on society. The RSPO 
      has production standards for growers that set best practices for 
      producing and sourcing palm oil, and it has the buy-in of most of 
      the global industry. RSPO encourage companies to: <br><br>
      -<b> Set robust policies to remove deforestation,
       conversion of other natural ecosystems, such as peatlands, 
       and human rights abuses from their supply chains. <br><br>
      - Buy and use RSPO certified palm oil across their operations globally <br><br>
      -Be transparent in their use and sourcing of palm oil ensuring they know who they are buying from and where it’s been produced</b><br><br>
      It is important that the palm oil industry continues to invest in and grow support for and smallholder programmes and sustainable landscape
       initiatives. WWF is also working with governments in both palm oil using and palm oil producing countries to make sure that 
       national laws are in place to ensure that any palm oil traded is free of deforestation, conversion and exploitation.  
  </p>
  <h3>
    Why don’t we just switch to an alternative vegetable oil?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Palm oil is an incredibly efficient crop, producing more oil per
     land area than any other equivalent vegetable oil crop. Globally, palm oil supplies
      40% of the world’s vegetable oil demand on just under 6% of the land used to produce all vegetable 
      oils. To get the same amount of alternative oils like soybean, coconut, or sunflower oil you would 
      need anything between 4 and 10 times more land, which would just shift the problem to other parts of 
      the world and threaten other habitats, species and communities. Furthermore, there are millions of smallholder
       farmers who depend on producing palm oil for their livelihoods. Boycotting palm oil is not the answer. Instead, 
       we need to demand more action to tackle the issues and go further and faster. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can I trust RSPO certified products?
  </h3>
  <p>
    The RSPO is the global standard for the sustainable production of palm oil. When palm oil is produced in adherence to RSPO standards,
     growers help to protect the environment and the local communities who depend on the crop for their livelihoods, so that palm oil can 
     continue to play a key role in food security, economic development, and food supply chains. We should continue to use RSPO certified 
     sustainable palm oil in products, as replacing it would result in more deforestation and natural habitat conversion. RSPO certified products
      that use palm oil from ‘Segregated’ or ‘Identity Preserved’ supply chains offer the greatest assurance of sustainable palm oil.<br><br>
      Along with other organisations, WWF plays an active role in influencing and shaping the RSPO standard to make sure it puts in place more safeguards 
      for people and the planet. In November 2018, the RSPO standard was strengthened and it now represents an essential tool that can help companies achieve 
      their commitments to palm oil that is free of deforestation, conversion of other natural habitats like peatlands, and the exploitation of people.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is being done in the UK?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In 2012, the UK Government recognised that we were part of the palm oil problem and could also be part of the solution. 
    They set a commitment for 100% of the palm oil used in the UK to be from sustainable sources that don’t harm nature or people. 
    In 2019, 70% of the total palm oil imports to the UK were sustainable. This is great progress but there is more to be done to get 
    to 100%.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Palm oil score card
  </h3>
  <p>
    The WWF have produced a score card which gives many businesses a score on how well they handle palm oils enviromental impact. 
    It is a very good reasource if you are interest in supporting businesses that are doing their part to reduce the impact of palm oils.
